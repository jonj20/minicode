# Multi-Edit — Enhanced Edit Tool

A pi extension that replaces the built-in `edit` tool with a more powerful version that supports **batch edits** across multiple files and **Codex-style patch payloads** — all validated against a virtual filesystem before any real changes are written.

## Origins

Initially derived from [mitsuhiko/agent-stuff](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff)'s `pi-extensions/multi-edit.ts`. The substrate has since been substantially rewritten — the patch engine is now a recursive-descent parser over a line cursor with `indexOf`-based hunk anchoring, the diff renderer is a two-pass design, and the classic edit path gained atomic multi-file rollback, eager write-permission preflight, curly-quote fallback matching, a read-cache backed workspace, and `context-guard:file-modified` event integration. Shape-level divergences (notably the `Hunk { oldBlock, newBlock }` shape vs upstream's `UpdateChunk { oldLines[], newLines[] }`) and dropped compatibility corners are documented below.

## Overview

The standard `edit` tool handles one `oldText → newText` replacement at a time. Multi-Edit extends it with three modes so an agent can make many targeted changes in a single tool call, dramatically reducing round-trips and the risk of partial edits leaving the codebase in an inconsistent state.

All modes run a **preflight pass** on a virtual (in-memory) copy of the filesystem first. If any replacement fails, no real files are touched.

## Modes

### 1. Single (classic)

Identical to the built-in `edit` tool. Provide `path`, `oldText`, and `newText`.

```jsonc
{
  "path": "src/index.ts",
  "oldText": "const foo = 1;",
  "newText": "const foo = 2;",
}
```

### 2. Multi (batch array)

Pass a `multi` array of edit objects. Each item has `path`, `oldText`, and `newText`. A top-level `path` can be set as a default that individual items inherit when they omit their own `path`.

```jsonc
{
  "path": "src/utils.ts", // inherited by items that omit path
  "multi": [
    {
      "oldText": "import foo from 'foo';",
      "newText": "import foo from '@scope/foo';",
    },
    {
      "path": "src/other.ts", // overrides the top-level path
      "oldText": "const bar = 0;",
      "newText": "const bar = 42;",
    },
  ],
}
```

You can also mix a top-level single edit with `multi` — the top-level edit is prepended as the first item in the batch:

```jsonc
{
  "path": "src/index.ts",
  "oldText": "version: 1",
  "newText": "version: 2",
  "multi": [{ "oldText": "// old comment", "newText": "// new comment" }],
}
```

### 3. Patch (Codex-style)

Pass a `patch` string delimited by `*** Begin Patch` / `*** End Patch`. This format supports adding, deleting, and updating files with hunk-based diffs — similar to the patch format used by OpenAI Codex.

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: src/new-file.ts
+export const greeting = "hello";
*** Delete File: src/deprecated.ts
*** Update File: src/existing.ts
@@ function oldName() {
-function oldName() {
+function newName() {
*** End Patch
```

**Supported operations inside a patch:**

| Header                    | Effect                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*** Add File: <path>`    | Creates (or overwrites) the file with `+`-prefixed lines as content |
| `*** Delete File: <path>` | Removes the file (errors if it doesn't exist)                       |
| `*** Update File: <path>` | Applies one or more `@@`-delimited hunks to the file                |

> **Note:** `*** Move to:` (rename) operations are not supported and will throw an error.

#### Codex apply_patch compatibility

The patch engine implements a pragmatic subset of the Codex `apply_patch` format. The following edge cases are intentionally **not** supported and raise a parse error instead of degrading silently:

| Feature                           | Status    | Notes                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@@` hunk header                  | Required  | Every hunk inside an `*** Update File:` block must start with `@@`                        |
| Trailing-whitespace tolerance     | Supported | Hunks fall back to per-line `trimEnd` matching when exact `indexOf` misses                |
| Full trim / unicode-normalized    | Dropped   | Only `trimEnd` is supported — normalize curly quotes or dashes in the patch before sending |
| `*** End of File` sentinel hunks  | Dropped   | Use a normal hunk anchored on the last real line                                          |
| `*** Move to:` rename             | Rejected  | Emit an Add + Delete pair instead                                                         |

These restrictions keep the parser simpler and more predictable than a full 4-pass fuzzy matcher while still catching the most common class of whitespace mismatch.

## Key Features

### Preflight Validation

Before writing a single byte to disk, every edit is applied to a virtual (in-memory) snapshot of the affected files. If any replacement fails — wrong `oldText`, file not found, missing context — the entire operation is aborted and no real files are modified. The preflight also checks write permissions against the real filesystem, so read-only targets fail fast before any virtual apply is attempted.

### Atomic Multi-File Rollback

When a classic batch spans multiple files, the applier snapshots each file's pre-edit content before writing it. If a later file in the batch fails mid-write, every file already written is restored from its snapshot on a best-effort basis — the original failure is still surfaced, but the filesystem ends up in its pre-batch state.

### Positional Ordering for Same-File Edits

When multiple edits target the same file, they are automatically sorted by their position in the **original** file content (top-to-bottom). This ensures the forward-search cursor works correctly regardless of the order the model listed the edits.

### Quote-Normalized Matching for Classic Edits

Classic `oldText` lookups escalate through an ordered list of normalizer passes applied to both `oldText` and file content. The first pass that locates the transformed string wins:

1. **Exact** — character-for-character match
2. **Curly → straight quotes** — `'` / `'` / `"` / `"` in the model's `oldText` are rewritten to ASCII before the second search
3. **Trailing whitespace tolerance** — per-line `trimEnd` on both sides catches the most frequent class of mismatch (model generates trailing spaces the file doesn't have, or vice versa)

Extending the chain is a matter of appending another normalizer to the `MATCH_PASSES` array in `classic.ts`.

Patch `@@` hunks also support a `trimEnd` fallback — when the exact `indexOf` misses, the applier retries with per-line trailing-whitespace stripping on both the hunk and the file content.

### Redundant Edit Detection

If the same `oldText → newText` pair appears more than once in a `multi` batch for the same file (e.g. the model over-counted occurrences), subsequent duplicates are skipped gracefully with a success status rather than raising an error.

### Diff Generation

Every successful edit returns a unified diff attached to the tool result so the agent and user can inspect exactly what changed. For multi-file operations, per-file diffs are concatenated. The first changed line number is also surfaced for UI scrolling.

### Path Inheritance

In `multi` mode, items that omit `path` automatically inherit the top-level `path`. This is convenient when most edits target a single file with one or two exceptions.

## Performance vs Base Edit

Measured across 38 real pi sessions (81 JSONL files) using `npm run bench -- --from-session --all`. Sessions are auto-classified: **base** = only single `path/oldText/newText` calls; **multi-edit** = uses `multi` or `patch` at least once.

### Headline Numbers

| Metric              |  Base | Multi-Edit |       Delta |
| ------------------- | ----: | ---------: | ----------: |
| Sessions            |    22 |         16 |             |
| Tool calls          |    92 |        137 |             |
| Logical edits       |    92 |        247 |             |
| Edits / tool call   |  1.00 |       1.80 |       +0.80 |
| Failure rate        |  6.5% |       6.6% |     +0.0 pp |
| P50 duration        |  7 ms |      11 ms |             |
| P95 duration        | 31 ms |      25 ms |             |
| Cost / logical edit | $0.29 |      $0.17 |      -41.8% |
| Calls saved vs base |     — |        110 | 44.5% fewer |

### What the data says

**Wins:**

- **Cost per edit drops 42%**. Batching N edits into one tool call avoids N-1 round-trips of assistant→tool→assistant, each of which carries the full conversation context as input tokens. At $0.17 vs $0.29 per logical edit, multi-edit pays for itself on any batch ≥ 2.
- **44.5% fewer tool calls**. 110 hypothetical round-trips eliminated. This is time the model spends re-reading its own context, waiting for tool dispatch, and generating boilerplate tool-call framing — all wasted.
- **P95 latency is lower** (25 ms vs 31 ms). The preflight + read cache avoids wasted disk I/O on doomed edits, and the cache deduplicates reads when multiple edits touch the same file.

**Neutral / watch items:**

- **P50 latency is slightly higher** (11 ms vs 7 ms). Expected: multi-edit does a full preflight pass before the real write. The delta is negligible per-edit (~2 ms extra for the safety guarantee).

### Mode Breakdown (pre-v1.5.1)

| Mode   | Calls |   % | Failure rate |
| ------ | ----: | --: | -----------: |
| single |    61 | 45% |         1.6% |
| patch  |    41 | 30% |         9.8% |
| multi  |    35 | 25% |        11.4% |

Root-cause analysis of the 8 multi/patch failures showed: 5 were trailing-whitespace mismatches in `oldText`, 2 were batch-poisoned (1 bad edit killed 5 good siblings), and 1 was a legitimate ENOENT. Three fixes shipped in v1.5.1 to address this:

1. **`trimEnd` matching for classic edits** — `findActualString` now tries a per-line `trimEnd` normalization pass on both `oldText` and file content when exact and curly-quote passes miss. Catches the dominant failure class (model generates trailing spaces the file doesn't have, or vice versa).
2. **Partial success for multi batches** — when one edit in a batch can't be found, the remaining edits are still applied. Failures are reported individually instead of aborting the entire batch. A 6-edit call with 1 bad edit now produces 5 successes + 1 failure instead of 0 + 6.
3. **`trimEnd` fallback for patch hunks** — the patch applier now falls back to per-line `trimEnd` matching when exact `indexOf` misses, using the same strategy for both `oldBlock` and `contextPrefix` anchors.

**Projected impact:** multi mode failure rate ~11.4% → ~3%, patch mode ~9.8% → ~2.5%. The batch-poisoning fix alone eliminates the inflated failure count — previously a single bad edit in a 6-edit batch counted as 1 failed tool call; now it counts as 1 failed edit + 5 successes.

Multi-edit sessions still use `single` mode 45% of the time — room to push batch adoption via prompt guidelines.

### Running the Benchmark & Analysis

The `benchmark-edits` tool provides two modes: a **synthetic benchmark** that measures engine latency on controlled scenarios, and a **session analysis** mode that parses historical pi session JSONL logs to compute cost, token, failure, and throughput metrics.

```bash
# Synthetic benchmark — built-in scenarios
npm run bench

# Custom scenario file (JSON array — see header comment in benchmark-edits.ts)
npm run bench -- scenarios.json

# Session analysis — all pi sessions
npm run bench -- --from-session --all

# Specific session files or directories
npm run bench -- --from-session ~/.pi/agent/sessions/<project-dir>/
npm run bench -- --from-session session1.jsonl session2.jsonl
```
